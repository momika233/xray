> A powerful security assessment tool

## ‚ú® Demo

![](https://docs.xray.cool/assets/term.svg)

üè†[Document](https://docs.xray.cool)  ‚¨áÔ∏è[Download](https://github.com/chaitin/xray/releases) 

> Note: xray is not open source, you can download the built binaries directly, and the poc in the repository, which is mainly contributed by the community, will be packaged automatically for each xray release.

## xray2.0

To address the complexity and bloat of xray 1.0 as features were added, we are introducing xray 2.0.

This new version is dedicated to improving the fluidity of feature usage, lowering the barrier to use, and helping more security industry practitioners to reap a better experience in a more efficient mode. xray 2.0 will integrate a series of new security tools to form a comprehensive security toolset.

**xray 2.0 series of the first tool xpoc has been launched, welcome to experience!**

- [**xpoc**](https://github.com/chaitin/xpoc)

## üöÄ Quick use

**Before using the tool, read and agree to the terms especially the disclaimer in the [License](https://github.com/chaitin/xray/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Otherwise, do not install or use the tool.**

1. Use the base basic web crawler scan to scrape and perform vulnerability scanning on the scraped links

    ```bash
    xray webscan --basic-crawler http://example.com --html-output vuln.html
    ```

2. Use an HTTP proxy for passive scanning

    ```bash
    xray webscan --listen 127.0.0.1:7777 --html-output proxy.html
    ```
   Set the browser http proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:7777` to analyze proxy traffic and scan automatically.

   >To scan https traffic, read the `Crawling https Traffic` section below

3. Only a single url is scanned, without crawlers

    ```bash
    xray webscan --url http://example.com/?a=b --html-output single-url.html
    ```

4. Manually configure the plugins to run this time

   By default, all built-in plugins are enabled. You can specify which plugins are enabled for this scan using the following command.

   ```bash
   xray webscan --plugins cmd-injection,sqldet --url http://example.com
   xray webscan --plugins cmd-injection,sqldet --listen 127.0.0.1:7777
   ```

5. Specifying plugin output

   You can choose targeted vulnerability and their details of this scan and export a report:

    ```bash
    xray webscan --url http://example.com/?a=b \
    --text-output result.txt --json-output result.json --html-output report.html
    ```

##  üîß Surrounding ecology

### POC authoring aids

The tool can assist in generating POC, and the online version supports * * poc duplicate check * *, and the local version supports direct contract verification

#### Online version

- [**Rule Lab**](https://poc.xray.cool)
- The online version supports duplicate checking of **poc**

#### Local version

- [**gamma-gui**]( https://github.com/zeoxisca/gamma-gui)

### Xray gui aids

This tool is only a simple command line wrapper, not a direct method call. In the planning of xray, there will be a truly complete GUI version of XrayPro tool in the future. Please look forward to it.
